Embed stepper PID controls and intelligent AI crash prevention for converted PM25MV CNC Mill. In the future I plan to implement feed rate optimization controllers. This will let me be an incompetent and careless  CNC  programmer with lesses destrotive consequence. I am uses linux cnc on a standerd several year old office PC. I am currently running it over parllel port, but plann to change to a MASA FPGA card. The linux CNC computer is publishing a G-Code, a camera, and tuch probe nodes. A Raspberry Pi sucribes to these nodes and monitors hazards. The Linux CNC computer is running ubuntu 20.04 with a real time kernal and the Pi is running regular Ubuntu 20.04 server image.

## Instlation
``Am still deep in the development and degugging phase of this project and there are still tons of bugs. When I am further along I will add detaild install instructions, ansible scripts for both computers, Solidworks files, Gerber files, and BOMs.
